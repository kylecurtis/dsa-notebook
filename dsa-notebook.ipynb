    "\n",
    "Big O notation is a mathematical concept used to describe the efficiency of an algorithm in terms of its time and space requirements. \n",

It gives us an idea of how long an algorithm will take to execute as the size of the input increases. | This is a measure of the amount of memory space required by an algorithm as the input size grows. It helps us understand how the memory usage of an algorithm will scale with larger inputs. |\n",

    "\n",

    "- Coefficients: Constants are typically omitted in Big O notation because they don't change the growth rate. For example, `2n` and `n` both simplify to `O(n)`, as they grow linearly with `n`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Multiple variables: For algorithms involving multi-dimensional data or operations, multiple variables can be used. For instance, in matrix multiplication, if one matrix is of size `m x n` and the other is `n x p`, the time complexity can be expressed as `O(mnp)`."

    "\n",
    "- **Example**: Accessing an element in an array by index. Whether your array has 10 items or 10,000, retrieving an element with array[5] always takes the same time.\n",

    "\n",

    "## Understanding Big O Notation\n",
    "\n",
    "Big O notation is a mathematical concept used to describe the efficiency of an algorithm in terms of its time and space requirements. \n",
    "\n",
    "It abstracts away constants and less significant terms to focus on the dominant factor that affects scalability.\n",
    "\n",

    "#### Categories of Computational Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "| Time Complexity | Space Complexity |\n",
    "|:---------------:|:----------------:|\n",
    "| This is a measure of the number of computational steps an algorithm takes relative to the input size. It gives us an idea of how long an algorithm will take to execute as the size of the input increases. | This is a measure of the amount of memory space required by an algorithm as the input size grows. It helps us understand how the memory usage of an algorithm will scale with larger inputs. |\n",
    "\n",
    "***Time complexity is generally what is discussed when referring to Big O, though space complexity is equally important in resource-constrained environments or with large datasets.***\n",

    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Big O Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "`O(n)`\n",
    "\n",
    "- The \"O\" stands for \"Order of,\" which refers to the growth rate of the algorithm's resource usage in the worst-case scenario.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The \"n\" symbolizes the size of the input, but it is not the only variable that can be used. The specific nature of the input or the algorithm can introduce other variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Coefficients and Multiple Variables in Big O:\n",
    "\n",
    "Coefficients and additional variables may appear alongside or instead of `n` to provide a more precise characterization of complexity:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Coefficients: Constants are typically omitted in Big O notation because they don't change the growth rate. For example, `2n` and `n` both simplify to `O(n)`, as they grow linearly with `n`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Multiple variables: For algorithms involving multi-dimensional data or operations, multiple variables can be used. For instance, in matrix multiplication, if one matrix is of size `m x n` and the other is `n x p`, the time complexity can be expressed as `O(mnp)`."

    "#### O(1) - Constant Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "- **What it means**: The term \"constant time\" implies that the operation's time does not change with the input size. No matter how large your dataset is, the algorithm takes a fixed amount of time.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Example**: Accessing an element in an array by index. Whether your array has 10 items or 10,000, retrieving an element with array[5] always takes the same time.\n",

    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### O(n) - Linear Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "- **What it means**: Here, 'n' represents the size of the input. O(n) means that the time taken grows linearly with the input size. If the input size doubles, so does the time taken.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Example**: Searching for an element in an unsorted list. In the worst case, you might have to look at every element once, so for a list twice as long, it'll take twice as long to search.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### O(log n) - Logarithmic Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "- **What it means**: Logarithmic time complexity is faster than linear time. Here, every time you double the size of your input, the number of steps needed increases by just one step or a small amount.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Example**: Binary search in a sorted array. Each time you divide the array in half, significantly reducing the number of elements you need to check.\n",

    "\n",
    "- **What it means**: Log-Linear complexity describes algorithms where the time taken increases linearly with the input size, but each step of the process involves a logarithmic number of operations. It's more efficient than quadratic time but less so than linear time for large datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Example**: Merge Sort is a typical example. It involves dividing the dataset into smaller halves (log n) and then combining them (n), leading to n log n operations overall. This makes it much faster than quadratic algorithms for large datasets.\n",

    "\n",
    "- **What it means**: Quadratic time means that if you double the input size, the time taken increases by four times (2^2). It grows significantly faster than linear time and can become inefficient for large inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Example**: A nested loop where for each element of the array, you perform another loop over the entire array, like in a simple sorting algorithm like bubble sort.\n",

    "\n",
    "- **What it means**: In exponential time, the growth of the runtime doubles with each addition to the input data set. This is generally unsustainable even for moderately large input sizes.\n",

    "\n",
    "- **What it means**: Factorial time complexity is even more extreme than exponential. Here, the number of operations increases factorially with the input size. It becomes impractical for even small input sizes.\n",
    "\n",
